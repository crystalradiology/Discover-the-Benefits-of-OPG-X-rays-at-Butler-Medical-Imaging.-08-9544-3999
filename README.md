An Orthopantomogram (OPG), commonly known as a dental X-ray, is a panoramic scanning dental X-ray of the upper and lower jaw. This imaging technique captures a broad view of the entire mouth, including all the teeth, the upper and lower jawbones, the temporomandibular joints (TMJ), and the sinus structures.
